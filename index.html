<p><a href="#instructions-for-contributing">Instructions for contributing</a></p>
<p>This document is for:</p>
<ul>
<li>people new to the topic who want a solid foundation at the start of their search for answers</li>
<li>skeptics who should consider that the answers aren&#39;t as simple as a single Google search or a mere day of topic perusal</li>
<li>journalists who want a primer on the history of the phenomenon</li>
<li>government leaders, representatives, fact finders, aides, bureaucrats</li>
<li>military rank-and-file, leaders, and investigators new to the topic</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a beginning with a few major concepts outlined in brief. If you don&#39;t know what something is, search it out to get more detail. Any included links are meant only as starting points and examples, not as the &quot;final word&quot; on anything. The reader is encouraged to do their own investigation and come to their own conclusions.</p>
<h2 id="unclassified-documents">UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS</h2>
<p>Start here. You&#39;ll see these referenced a lot in both good UFO books and bad. It&#39;s important to know what the documents say and don&#39;t say first so that you can filter author opinions from reality. That also goes for opinions of any skeptics reading this. The documents don&#39;t exist in a vacuum. Indeed, if nothing like the craft that UFOs represent exists, then why do these documents exist at all? There&#39;s a history before, during, and after their creation that is important to pay attention to in order to fully understand what they mean and what they&#39;re saying/not saying.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just because something is unclassified doesn&#39;t mean there was no good reason to classify it initially. If you read the documents, you&#39;ll find a number of places where the information that justified its classification is either redacted for privacy or defense concerns, or is so outdated as to no longer require classification for the government&#39;s purposes. Also, there&#39;s the problem of deception by omission. We don&#39;t know for sure what is missing from these archives. But there are some context clues if you read between the lines.</p>

<h2 id="projects-and-committees">PROJECTS AND COMMITTEES</h2>
<p>The following projects and committees produced large amounts of classified and unclassified documentation, reports, studies, and other media on UFOs. They are referenced in numerous books and other publications about UFOs. It&#39;s important to know their names, timelines, players, and conclusions when consuming the materials they produced.</p>

<p>Much of this list comes from <a href="https://www.richarddolanpress.com/twelve-government-documents">Richard Dolan&#39;s excellent roundup</a>. Read his summaries on them, but also read the documents themselves. Look for the logic in writing and hiding so much on something that was later considered by top brass to be nothing more than &quot;mass hysteria&quot; or &quot;weather phenomena&quot;. But then even later admitted to be real and problematic for pilots.</p>

<h2 id="news-coverage-since-december-2017">NEWS COVERAGE SINCE DECEMBER 2017</h2>
<p>The demarcation line for these &quot;starter kit&quot; articles is December 2017 onward, from when the New York Times broke the story about AATIP until now, in reverse chronological order. I may add other articles from earlier for reference, but this is &quot;what matters most&quot;, currently, in terms of legitimizing and destigmatizing the topic. Prior articles were always plausibly deniable given that the government hadn&#39;t yet seen fit to release (or allow to leak) materials with unbroken chains of custody or to acknowledge these craft exist. They are now of much more worth given recent developments.</p>
